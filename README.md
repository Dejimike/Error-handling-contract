# Error Handling Contract
  This is a Solidity smart contract demonstrating different error handling mechanisms: assert, require, and revert.

## Contract Functions
  ### assertStatement(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)
  This function performs an addition operation on two unsigned integers _a and _b. It then uses the assert statement to ensure that the result of the addition is greater than _a. If not, it will trigger an assertion failure. If the condition in the assert statement is true (i.e., if the addition did not overflow), the function continues execution normally.
If the condition in the assert statement evaluates to false (i.e., if an overflow occurred), the execution of the function halts immediately, reverting any changes made to the state of the contract and consuming all remaining gas. This behavior helps prevent unexpected and potentially harmful outcomes resulting from arithmetic errors.

### requireStatement(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)
  This function performs a division operation on two unsigned integers _a and _b. It uses the require statement to check if _b is not equal to zero before performing the division operation. If _b is zero, it will revert with a custom error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed.

### revertStatement(uint256 _a, uint256 _b)
  This function also performs a division operation on two unsigned integers _a and _b. It uses an if statement to check if _b is equal to zero. If _b is zero, it will revert with a custom error message indicating that division by zero is not allowed. Inside the function, there's an if statement that checks if _b is equal to zero. This condition checks for division by zero, which is not allowed in arithmetic operations.

If _b is indeed zero, the function execution is halted immediately, and an error message "Division by zero is not allowed" is provided as the reason for the revert. The keyword revert is used here to revert the transaction and discard any state changes that may have occurred before the revert.

If _b is not zero (meaning division by zero is avoided), the function proceeds to execute the division operation _a / _b and returns the result.
